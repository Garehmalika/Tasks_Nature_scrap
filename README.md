# Web Scraping and Data Extraction Project

## Project Overview
This project involves multiple tasks aimed at scraping and extracting data from various sources, including the NATRUE website and INCI database. The tasks include scraping data for products, raw materials, and brands, structuring raw materials in a specific format, and identifying relevant business contacts. The project also includes the use of low-code tools to create workflows for mapping out business development managers.

## Task 1: Scraping Data from the NATRUE Website

### Objective:
Scrape information about products, raw materials, and brands from the NATRUE certified database. The data will be structured in JSON format and stored in Google Sheets.

### Details:
- **Products**: Extract detailed information about NATRUE certified products, such as product names, descriptions, ingredients, and certifications.
- **Raw Materials**: Extract raw materials data (available in Excel) including material names, types, uses, and certifications.
- **Brands**: Scrape detailed information about NATRUE certified brands, including brand names, product offerings, and other relevant data.

### Deliverables:
- **GPT Prompt**: A detailed prompt to guide the creation of Python code for scraping NATRUE data.
- **Python Script**: A Python script to scrape the NATRUE website and process the data.
- **JSON and Google Sheets**: Structured data in JSON format and Google Sheets containing the scraped data.
- **GitHub Repo**: A GitHub repository containing the Python script, prompts, and documentation.
- **Tests**: Tests to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the scraping process.
- **Time Report**: A report on the total time spent on completing this task.

## Task 2: Extract and Structure Raw Materials from INCI

### Objective:
Extract individual raw materials from the INCI (International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients) and structure them similar to the page for Alpaca on Commonshare.

### Details:
- Extract raw materials from the INCI database and structure them to match the required format.
- Ensure that the standard and countries for each raw material are 100% accurate.

### Deliverables:
- **GPT Prompt**: A detailed prompt for generating a Python script to extract and structure raw materials.
- **Python Script**: A Python script to extract and format raw materials from INCI.
- **Google Drive Docs**: A Google Drive folder containing individual documents for each material.
- **Time Report**: A report on the total time spent on completing this task.

## Task 3 (Extra Credit): Identifying Marketing and Business Development Managers

### Objective:
Use low-code tools to identify the marketing and business development managers at the scraped brands and material manufacturers.

### Details:
- Use tools like **draw.io**, **mermaid.js**, or other low-code platforms to create workflows for identifying relevant business contacts.
- Organize the contact information of these managers in a Google Sheet.

### Deliverables:
- **Tools Used**: List of low-code tools used, such as **draw.io**, **mermaid.js**, etc.
- **Workflow**: A visual workflow of the process used to identify the marketing and business development managers.
- **Google Sheets**: A Google Sheet containing the contact details of the relevant managers.
- **Time Report**: A report on the total time spent on completing this task.
